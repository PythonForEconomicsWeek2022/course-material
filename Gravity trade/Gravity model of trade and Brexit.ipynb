    "# Gravity Model of Trade \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a demonstration for LSE undergraduate economics students for a python weekend. The gravity model of trade has become an issue of contention in recent year. Brexit instigated a debate about the gravity model and the models stated benefits to trade with the EU. Since 2016 government departments and think tanks have made the case for and against EU membership using the gravity model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project gives an insight into the intuition behind the gravity model, and an opportunity to explore further its application to the UK's future outside the EU. \n",

    "### The basic gravity mdoel \n",
    "In its most basic form, the gravity model can be written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1a) log𝑋𝑖𝑗 = 𝑐 + 𝑏1 log 𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑖 + 𝑏2 log 𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑗 + 𝑏3 log 𝜏𝑖𝑗 + 𝑒𝑖𝑗\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(1𝑏) log 𝜏𝑖𝑗 = log(𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑖𝑗)\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "* 𝑋𝑖𝑗 indicates exports from country i to country j, \n",
    "* GDP is each country’s gross domestic product,\n",
    "* 𝜏𝑖𝑗 represents trade costs between the two countries, \n",
    "* _distance_ is the geographical distance between them—as an observable proxy for trade costs—and \n",
    "* 𝑒𝑖𝑗 is a random error term. \n",
    "* c is a regression constant, and \n",
    "* b terms are coefficients to be estimated. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does the model show? \n",
    "The name “gravity” comes from the fact that the nonlinear form of equation (1a) resembles Newton’s law of gravity: exports are directly proportional to the exporting and importing countries’ economic “mass” (GDP), and inversely\n",
    "proportional to the distance between them (not the square of the distance between them, as in\n",
    "physics). \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, gravity says: \n",
    "1. We expect larger country pairs to trade more, but \n",
    "2. We expect countries that are further apart to trade less (perhaps because transport costs between them are higher)."
