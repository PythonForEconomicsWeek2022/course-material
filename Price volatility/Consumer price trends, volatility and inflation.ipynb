With several items being missing from stores as a result of stockpiling and weak supply-chains, alongside the difficulty of the forced closure of shops where price collectors would carry out instore price scanning. Policymakers have also impacted consumer prices with the VAT cut for the hospitality industry and the energy price cap. \n",
